# This workflow is designed to automate the process of building and deploying a Kotlin/JS web application to GitHub Pages.
# It ensures that whenever changes are merged into the dev branch or when manually triggered, the web application is built,
# packaged, and deployed to the GitHub Pages environment, making it accessible online.

# Key Features:
# - Automated web application build using Kotlin/JS
# - Deployment to GitHub Pages
# - Supports configurable web project module name
# - Manages deployment concurrency and environment settings
# - Provides secure deployment with proper permissions

# Prerequisites:
# - Kotlin Multiplatform/JS project configured with Gradle
# - Web module set up for browser distribution
# - Java 17 or compatible version
# - GitHub Pages enabled in repository settings

# Workflow Configuration:
# - Requires input of `web_package_name` to specify the web project module
# - Uses Windows runner for build process
# - Leverages GitHub Actions for build, pages configuration, and deployment

# Workflow Triggers:
# - Can be manually called from other workflows
# - Supports workflow_call for reusability across projects

# Deployment Process:
# 1. Checkout repository code
# 2. Set up Java development environment
# 3. Build Kotlin/JS web application
# 4. Configure GitHub Pages
# 5. Upload built artifacts
# 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages
