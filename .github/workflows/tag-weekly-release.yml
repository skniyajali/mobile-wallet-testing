# Weekly Release Tagging and Beta Deployment Workflow
# ===================================================

# Purpose:
# - Automate weekly version tagging for consistent software versioning
# - Trigger automated beta releases across multiple platforms
# - Maintain a predictable release cycle

# Workflow Overview:
# - Runs automatically every Sunday at 4:00 AM UTC
# - Supports manual triggering via workflow_dispatch
# - Utilizes Gradle Reckon plugin for intelligent versioning
# - Triggers multi-platform build and publish workflow

# Key Features:
# - Automatic semantic versioning
# - Cross-platform release automation
# - Configurable target branch for releases
# - Full repository history checkout for accurate versioning

# Versioning Strategy:
# - Uses Reckon Gradle plugin for semantic versioning
# - Generates production-ready (final) version tags
# - Provides consistent and predictable version incrementation

# Release Process:
# 1. Checkout repository with full commit history
# 2. Setup Java 17 development environment
# 3. Create and push new version tag
# 4. Trigger multi-platform build and publish workflow

# Prerequisites:
# - Gradle project configured with Reckon plugin
# - Java 17 development environment
# - Configured multi-platform build workflow
# - GitHub Actions permissions for workflow dispatch

# Workflow Inputs:
# - target_branch: Branch to use for releases (default: 'dev')
#   Allows flexible release targeting across different branches

# Security Considerations:
# - Uses GitHub's native GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication
# - Controlled workflow dispatch with specific inputs
# - Limited to authorized repository members

# Potential Use Cases:
# - Regular software release cycles
# - Automated beta testing distributions
# - Consistent multi-platform deployment

# Workflow Triggers:
# - Scheduled weekly run (Sunday 4:00 AM UTC)
# - Manual workflow dispatch
# - Callable from other workflows
